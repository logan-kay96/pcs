VideoConstraints:
    Predifined constraints for video input
    sets for a 720p image from the user-facing camera (if applicable)

WebcamCapture Functional Component:

    Screen Size Shinnanigans region:

        const [dimensions, setDimensions] is used for setting the initial state. It is used as an anonymous object
        so that it doesn't take up room on memory, as an object would not be referenced in the future.
            By using the useState hook on this section, we create a state based value for the parent functional component
            that will hold the width and height of the screen.

        The handleResize effect is used for triggering a section of code on the resize event. "Resize" is an event that 
        is tracked by native JS and core html5.
            the constant handleResize is the listener that will trigger
            The setDimensions method is imported from useState, and takes in arguements for both the width and height
        
        the adding and removal of listeners is for many reasons including memory-leak avoidal, and prevention of
        potentially stacking many listeners on one functional component

        the [] is an dependancy array. This, when specified, will insure that an effect only runs based on dependancy values.
        Because we don't have any value based restrictions in this case, the dependancy array is empty.

    Webcam JSX Prop:
        Sets audio as false, as we don't need audio for a screenshot
        sets height equal to the dimension-state height
        sets width equal to the dimension-state width
        sets the image format equal to jpg
        Sets video constraints equal to pre-defined video constraints

     getScreenshot is a function inside of the prop jsx. The syntax here is a little wild because it is seeded
     inside of jsx, just ignore the excessive parenthetics and bracketry.
        the getScreenshot function creates and sets a listener for a button that triggers the getScreenshot method
        provided by react-webcam.
